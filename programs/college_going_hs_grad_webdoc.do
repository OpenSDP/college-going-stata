# High School Graduation
#### *College-Going Pathways*
#### *Stata Version*

## Getting Started

### Objective

In this guide you will be able to visualize high school graduation rates
by high school, student achievement level before high school, student
race/ethnicity, on-track status after ninth-grade.

### Using this Guide

The College-Going Pathways series is a set of guides, code, and sample data about
policy-relevant college-going topics. Browse this and other guides in the series for
ideas about ways to investigate student pathways through high school and
college. Each guide includes several analyses in the form of charts together with Stata
analysis and graphing code to generate each chart.

Once youâ€™ve identified analyses that you want to try to replicate or modify, click the
"Download" buttons to download Stata code and sample data. You can make changes to the
charts using the code and sample data, or modify the code to work with your own data. If
you're familiar with Github, you can click "Go to Repository" and clone the entire
College-Going Pathways repository to your own computer.

### About the Data

The data visualizations in the College-Going Pathways series use a synthetically
generated college-going analysis sample data file which has one record per student. Each
high school student is assigned to a ninth-grade cohort, and each student record includes
demographic and program participation information, annual GPA and on-track status, high
school graduation outcomes, and college enrollment information. The Connect guide (coming
soon) will provide guidance and example code which will help you build a college-going
analysis file using data from your own school system.

### About the Analyses

High school graduation is a critical step to higher education. Understanding
trends and variations in high school completion rates across schools and student
subgroups is essential. These analyses reveal the extent to which high schools
may differentially influence student trajectories towards high school
completion. After identifying these high schools, you may conduct deeper
analyses on your own to explore what drives these outcomes.

### Sample Restrictions

One of the most important decisions in running each analysis is
defining the sample. Each analysis corresponds to a different part of the education
pipeline and as a result requires different cohorts of students.

If you are using the synthetic data we have provided, the sample restrictions have been
predefined and are included below. If you run this code using your own agency data,
change the sample restrictions based on your data. Note that you will have to run these
sample restrictions at the beginning of your do file so they will feed into the rest of
your code.

global chrt_grad_end = 2009

// High school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in college two years after hs graduation
global chrt_grad_begin_delayed = 2007
global chrt_grad_end_delayed = 2009

/***

Based on the sample data, you will have three cohorts (sometimes only
two) for analysis. If you are using your own agency data, you may decide
to aggregate results for more or fewer cohorts to report your results. This
decision depends on 1) how much historical data you have available and
2) what balance to strike between reliability and averaging
away information on recent trends. We suggest you average results for the last
three cohorts to take advantage of larger sample sizes and improve reliability.
However, if you have data for more than three cohorts, you may decide to not
average data out for fear of losing information about trends and recent changes
in your agency.

Webdoc package. We welcome feedback, corrections, additions, and updates. Please

## Analyses

### High School Completion Rates By School

**Purpose:** This analysis explores variation in high school completion rates
across high schools in the system for both on-time and late high school
graduates.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `hs_diploma`
- `ontime_grad`
- `late_grad`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:** Keep students in ninth
grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school one year late

**Ask Yourself**

- Does the ordering of high school completion rates coincide with beliefs key
stakeholders have about these high schools?

- Which high schools have the highest and lowest completion rates? Do you know
why?

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who complete high
school by school.

### High School Completion Rates by Average 8th Grade Achievement

**Purpose:**  This analysis examines the relationship between academic
achievement at high school entry and high school completion rates. This
analysis is useful to identify high schools that beat the odds. High schools
with similar incoming student achievement profiles but different high school
graduation rates.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop any high schools with less than 20 students enrolled in
ninth grade across the cohorts.

**Ask Yourself**

What might explain differences in high school graduation rates for high schools
with similar incoming achievement? What might explain differences in incoming
achievement for high schools with similar graduation rates?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** If substantial variation exists after
controlling for average student achievement at high school entry, think about
how to share this information across schools. To explore mechanisms that drive
school-level differences in high school completion rates, replicate this
analysis where the x-axis is a middle school at-risk index (e.g. an index that
accounts for whether students failed a core class, were chronically absent, and
other information predictive of student achievement in high school) in place of
8th grade test scores.

**Analytic Technique:** Bivariate scatterplot of school-level average student
test scores and high school completion rates.

### High School Completion Rates by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles


**Purpose:** This analysis examines variation in completion rates for high
schools  among students with 8th grade test scores in the same quartile. The
analysis is useful to explore high school completion rates across schools with
students in the same quartile or range of achievement. Each high school is
repeated as a blue bar in each quartile.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop high schools with less than 20 students in each quartile
enrolled in ninth grade across the cohorts.

**Ask Yourself**

- Looking at the average in each quartile (orange bars), how do 8th grade test
scores relate to high school graduation?
- For each quartile of 8th grade test scores (the blue bars), how do graduation
rates vary by high school? What is the difference between top and bottom high
schools in each quartile?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Highlight comparison schools to show
variation across quartiles and explore reasons why students at different
schools, but with similar academic profiles at high school entry, are more or
less likely to graduate.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students, by high school, who
complete high school and an 8th grade test score quartile for each.

### Racial Gaps in Completion Overall and by 8th Grade Achievement Quartiles

**Purpose:** This analysis displays an overall graduation gap by race, and
examines the extent to which this gap is explained by average differences in
academic achievement between racial sub-groups at high school entry. The
analysis is useful to diagnose whether racial gaps in high school result from
persistent academic achievement gaps that emerge in early grades, or if other
factors unique to the high school experience drive high school completion rate
differences by race.

**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `test_math_8_std`
- `hs_diploma`
- `first_hs_code`
- `first_hs_name`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**

- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND have non-missing eighth grade
math scores.
- Drop any race/ethnic sub-groups with at least 20 students
in each quartile (for the second graph). You may further
restrict the sample to only include students from the most
representative racial/ethnic sub-groups in your agency.

**Ask Yourself**

- How do racial gaps in graduation rates change after prior achievement is
accounted for? Do these gaps change for different prior achievement quartiles?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat analyses for only students that
qualify for free or reduced price lunch (FRPL) to explore if racial gaps are
better explained by disparities in prior academic achievement and family
socioeconomic status.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who complete high
school by race/ethnicity overall, and by race/ethnicity and 8th grade test
score quartile.

### Enrollment Outcome in Year Four By On-Track Status At the End of Ninth Grade

**Purpose:** This analysis explores how strongly student performance in ninth grade
predicts high school graduation three years later. Building upon our analysis
of the relationship between student performance in ninth and tenth grade, the
analysis assesses the utility of using course-level performance data early in
studentsâ€™ high school careers to assess risk of non-completion, and target
students in need of academic and/or socio-emotional support.


**Required Analysis File Variables:**

- `sid`
- `chrt_ninth`
- `ontrack_grad_hs_sample*`
- `ontrack_endyr1*`
- `cum_gpa_yr1*`
- `status_after_yr4*`

**Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:**
- Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe
graduating high school AND are part of the on-track sample
(attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred
into or out of the system).

**Ask Yourself**
- How does on-track status at the end of ninth grade relate to high school
completion status at the end of four years?

**Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:** Repeat analyses for only students that
qualify for free or reduced price lunch (FRPL) to explore whether racial gaps
are better explained by disparities in prior academic achievement and family
socioeconomic status.

**Analytic Technique:** Calculate the proportion of students who graduate high
school within four years, dropout, remain enrolled in high school for a fifth
year, etc. based on on-track status upon completion of ninth grade.
