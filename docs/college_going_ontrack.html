Getting Started
</h2>
<h3 id="h-1-1-1">
Objective
</h3>
<p>In this guide you will be able to visualize the share of students who are on track to graduate on time after ninth grade by high school and by their on-track status after tenth grade.</p>
<h3 id="h-1-1-2">
Using this Guide
</h3>
<p>The College-Going Pathways series is a set of guides, code, and sample data about policy-relevant college-going topics. Browse this and other guides in the series for ideas about ways to investigate student pathways through high school and college. Each guide includes several analyses in the form of charts together with Stata analysis and graphing code to generate each chart.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified analyses that you want to try to replicate or modify, click the &quot;Download&quot; buttons to download Stata code and sample data. You can make changes to the charts using the code and sample data, or modify the code to work with your own data. If you're familiar with Github, you can click &quot;Go to Repository&quot; and clone the entire College-Going Pathways repository to your own computer.</p>
<h3 id="h-1-1-3">
About the Data
</h3>
<p>The data visualizations in the College-Going Pathways series use a synthetically generated college-going analysis sample data file which has one record per student. Each high school student is assigned to a ninth-grade cohort, and each student record includes demographic and program participation information, annual GPA and on-track status, high school graduation outcomes, and college enrollment information. The Connect guide (coming soon) will provide guidance and example code which will help you build a college-going analysis file using data from your own school system.</p>
<h3 id="h-1-1-4">
About the Analyses
</h3>
<p>Research suggests that academic performance in ninth grade strongly predicts the likelihood of a student dropping out of high school. In this section, you examine patterns of student retention and on-time transitions from ninth to tenth grade. This information can provide an early warning to an agency with students at-risk of dropping out, and might benefit from targeted support early in their high school careers.</p>
<h3 id="h-1-1-5">
Sample Restrictions
</h3>
<p>One of the most important decisions in running each analysis is defining the sample. Each analysis corresponds to a different part of the education pipeline and as a result requires different cohorts of students.</p>
<p>If you are using the synthetic data we have provided, the sample restrictions have been predefined and are included below. If you run this code using your own agency data, change the sample restrictions based on your data. Note that you will have to run these sample restrictions at the beginning of your do file so they will feed into the rest of your code.</p>
<pre id="stlog-1" class="stcmd"><code>
<span class="stcmt">// Sample Restrictions</span>

<span class="stcmt">// Agency name</span>
global agency_name "Agency"

<span class="stcmt">// Ninth grade cohorts you can observe persisting to the second year of college</span>
global chrt_ninth_begin_persist_yr2 = 2004
global chrt_ninth_end_persist_yr2 = 2006

<span class="stcmt">// Ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time</span>
global chrt_ninth_begin_grad = 2004
global chrt_ninth_end_grad = 2006

<span class="stcmt">// Ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school one year late</span>
global chrt_ninth_begin_grad_late = 2004
global chrt_ninth_end_grad_late = 2006

<span class="stcmt">// High school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in college the fall after graduation</span>
global chrt_grad_begin = 2007
global chrt_grad_end = 2009

<span class="stcmt">// High school graduation cohorts you can observe enrolling in college two years after hs graduation</span>
global chrt_grad_begin_delayed = 2007
global chrt_grad_end_delayed = 2009
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the sample data, you will have three cohorts (sometimes only two) for analysis. If you are using your own agency data, you may decide to aggregate results for more or fewer cohorts to report your results. This decision depends on 1) how much historical data you have available and 2) what balance to strike between reliability and averaging away information on recent trends. We suggest you average results for the last three cohorts to take advantage of larger sample sizes and improve reliability. However, if you have data for more than three cohorts, you may decide to not average data out for fear of losing information about trends and recent changes in your agency.</p>

Analyses
</h2>
<h3 id="h-1-2-1">
Proportion of Students On-Track by High School
</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This analysis illustrates what percent of students are on-track after ninth grade graduate from each high school and the agency as a whole. Different levels of on-track for graduation are distinguished by high school.</p>
<p><strong>Required Analysis File Variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sid</code></li>
<li><code>chrt_ninth</code></li>
<li><code>first_hs-Name</code></li>
<li><code>first_hs_code</code></li>
<li><code>ontrack_endyr1*</code></li>
<li><code>cum_gpa_yr1</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:</strong> Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time AND are part of the on-track sample (attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred into or out of the system).</p>
<p><strong>Ask Yourself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How does the percent of students on-track differ by high school (consider the overall height of each bar)?</li>
<li>How does the percent of students on-track for an advanced versus general diploma differ by high school (consider the different components of each bar)?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:</strong> Overall school-level results can be disaggregated by student subgroups of interest, (race, FRPL status, and eighth grade academic achievement).</p>
<p><strong>Analytic Technique:</strong> Calculate the proportion of students on-track at each school, and across the agency.</p>

Ninth To Tenth Grade Transition by On-Track Status
</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This analysis explores how on-track status after ninth grade (the horizontal axis) predicts ontrack status in tenth grade (the vertical axis). This analysis is useful for developing early dropout warning indicators for at-risk students as early as the second semester of ninth grade.</p>
<p><strong>Required Analysis File Variables:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>sid</code></li>
<li><code>chrt_ninth</code></li>
<li><code>first_hs_name</code></li>
<li><code>first_hs_code</code></li>
<li><code>ontrack_endyr1*</code></li>
<li><code>cum_gpa_yr1*</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis-Specific Sample Restrictions:</strong> Keep students in ninth grade cohorts you can observe graduating high school on time AND are part of the on-track sample (attended the first semester of ninth grade and never transferred into or out of the system).</p>
<p><strong>Ask Yourself:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What percent of those in a specific on-track category at the end of ninth grade stay in that same on-track category? For example, what percent of off-track ninth graders continue off-track in tenth grade?</li>
<li>How might you use an early warning system to help students get back on-track for graduation?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible Next Steps or Action Plans:</strong> Identify additional risk factors, (chronic absenteeism, prior academic achievement etc.) which can be incorporated into analyses like the one above. This could be used to further understand which students struggle, why they struggle, and interventions to keep them enrolled and engaged.</p>
